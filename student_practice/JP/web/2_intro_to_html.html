    <h2>Intro to HTML</h2>

    <p>This is a website!</p>

    <p>HTML is made out of HTML 'elements'. An element in HTML is a fundamental building block used to structure and organize content on a webpage. It acts like a container or a box that can hold other HTML elements like text, images, or other divs. By applying CSS styles to divs, you can control their appearance, layout, and positioning on the page, making them versatile for creating columns, sections, or entire layouts.</p>

    <p>Elements are pieces of content that are wrapped in HTML 'tags'. 
     These tags are structured as pairs that 'open' and 'close'. For example,</p>
    <code>&lt;div&gt; Hello World! &lt;/div&gt;</code>
    <p>is a 'div' element that contains the text, 'Hello World'.</p>
    <p>Each tag opens and closes with the matching element type (in chis case, 'div'), and the slash (/) on the second tag indicates that we're closing the tag.</p>

    <b>Challenge: There's a typo on this page that is rendering much of the text as italics. Can you fix it?</b>

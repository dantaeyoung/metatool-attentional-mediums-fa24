        <div class="description">To establish a conducive environment for graditude jornaling, I've decided to turn my study table into a sanctury for writing gratitude thoughts. I sat at the newly organized study tbale for 30 minutes and wrote in my 'thankfulness diary'. The peaceful surrounding generated by the spatial internvention greatl improved my experience.
          <li>Increased focus: The calming environment helped me to quiet my mind and concentrate on the practice.</li>
          <li>Enhanced emotional well-being: Expressing gratitude in a peaceful setting seemed to have a more profound impact on my mood and overall well-being.</li>
          <li>Deepened connection: The physical space felt like a sacred place, fostering a deeper connection with myself and my thoughts.</li>
          <li>Improved creativity: The aesthetic appeal of the space inspired creative journaling, leading to more detailed and heartfelt entries.</li>

        <div class="title">Affordances of the spatial environment</div>
        <div class="description">To understand the relation I further created a "Gratitude Corner" in my study area. I Designated the right corner of my desk beside the planter as my dedicated gratitude space. Added a small, aesthetically pleasing container in this corner to serve as a "Gratitude Jar." This will be a physical representation of my growing appreciation. Each day, before your regular journaling session, I write one thing Iâ€™m grateful for on and place it in the jar. Once a week, I will empty the jar and read through your week's gratitudes before starting my journaling practice.</div>

        <div class="title">Strange and strong affordances</div>
        <div class="description">To re-invision and re-understand the objects and spaces through their affordances,not by their names,categories or class etc. The room has so many possibilities, so I chose some objects present in the surrounding place of my practice: Table; Chair; Lamp; Gratitude writing paper and Jar. where the affordances of each selected object is taken to point of absurdity where the table and chair are used in total opposite sense; The lamp is turned up-side-down where the one word thought is written in the shadow space of the inverted lamp and the 'Gratitude jar' is used from the outside where the gratitude thoughts written on chits are stuck on the outside of the jar to see their affordances at that point.
          <li>Distracted focus: The absurd environment wether it was the table I sat on or the inverted chair I wrote on felt uncomfortable which led to distracting my mind and concentration on the practice.
          <li>Multi connection: The physical space around started having multiple focus points due to the distractions, hence causing fragmented thoughts.</li>
          <li>Materiality: Due to the absurd usage of the objects, the materials of the inverted objects felt quite different and altogether provided a new experience for my gratitude journaling.</li>

        <div class="date">10.2.2024</div>
        <div class="title">Stranger and stronger affordances!</div>
        <div class="description">To create more absurdity in the affordances of the selcted objects in the surrounding, I took the same objects and used them at different angles more absurd than last time. This time I invited my roommates to be present in the space as they go on with their usual acitvities like reading; talking; working on laptop etc. So there is a combination of absurd affordances and other users of the spatial intervention created from the start. This led to having more distracted and shorter attention span towards writing gratitude thoughts on the chits.  </div>

        <div class="description">To Create a large, tactile dial that represents different states of attention. As the user turns the dial, various environmental factors change to support different attentional states.
          <li>Components</li>
          <li>1. Large, smooth-turning dial (controlled by a stepper motor)</li>
          <li>2. LED ring around the dial for visual feedback</li>
          <li>3. Speakers for audio cues</li>
          
          <li>Functionality</li>
          <li>1. The dial has distinct "clicks" or positions, each representing a different attentional state (e.g., "Focused", "Open Awareness", "Rest", "Creative Flow")</li>
          <li>2. As the user turns the dial: The stepper motor provides haptic feedback; LEDs change color and intensity; Ambient lighting in the room shifts and Audio atmosphere adjusts (white noise, nature sounds, music) </li>

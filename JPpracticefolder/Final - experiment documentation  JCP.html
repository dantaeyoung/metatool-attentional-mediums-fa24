            <p>HABIT CREATION WEEK: I began my journey by introducing the concept of gratitude journaling out of other habits such as mindful reading, digital detox, mindful eating and skill development. Where I spent  15 - 20 minutes each day before bedtime writing down three things they are grateful for. Initially I started the gratitude journaling on my bedspace for two days, where I found myself quite distracted. So as an intervention to the site of my gratitude journaling I established a conducive environment where I coverted my study table into a personal santuary. With the soft natural light coming in and a little potted plant along a well-lit lamp on the table. As I sat at my newly organized table and wrote doen my gratitude thoughts. Overall I had more increased focus that led to having a deepened connection to the thoughts and improved the creativity aspect of journaling.</p>

            <p>AFFORDANCES WEEK: During this week I explored the relation between attention and the affordances of the spatial environmen I am in. I cut down the time I spent each day on journaling from 20 minutes to 5 minutes. To further understand the relation I created a 'Gratitude corner' in my study area, where I designated the right corner of my desk beside the planter. And added a small jar to collect these gratitude thoughts. That shows a visual representation for the growing appreciation I'm building. At the end of the week I felt more organized in the way my thoughts were constructed. I felt very satisfied seeing the gratitude jar fill up during this week.</p>

            <p>STRANGE AFFORDANCES WEEK: With the spatial affordances I created in the previous week, we had to make the affordances strange! as in the same space and objects but using them in a very absurd manner. So to achieve this I flipped all the objects in the space to create a strange spatial affordance. I sat on the desk while I wrote on the base of the chair with the lamp facing upwards. While performing the experiment it was uncomfortable with sitting & the effect of shadow on the space. This taught me about the affordnace each object offers, where the table afforded the ability to write on and the chair afforded the ability to sit on and similarly the lamp's affordance to provide the lighting. I was very distracted with my spatial environment that affected my concentration majorly.</p>

            <h3>October 2, 2024</h3>
            <p>RAISING THE LEVEL OF STRANGENESS WEEK: To further level it up to extreme absurdity, I switched off the light and turned the lamp on facing upwards like last time, switched the book I wrote my thoughts in to sheets to further smaller chits. And the stuck the chits all over the jar instead of collecting in it. All this further caused a very unsettling and distrating environment, where I couldnt focus at all on my thoughts while journaling. During this week I learnt how much the affordances of objects around us have a great impact on our attention. But my main study behind the device I wanted to develop was with the strange affordance where the lights switched off and the lamp facing upwards. Take away from this experiment was the importance of light and shadows in the spatial environment.</p>

            <p>ATTENTIONAL ARTIFACTS WEEK: With the experiments conducted in the previous weeks have helped conceptualise an attentional atrifact called "The mind dial" where the idea behind this is to give the user the ability to control the lighting with its further development with other aspects such as sound and scent etc while journaling. The dial is a circular shaped disk with quadrants developed to suit certain moods or attentional intensity. The four quadrants are Focused, Open awareness, Creative flow and Rest/ calm respectively. Where the user chooses the kind of spatial environment they want and clicks on the respective mode. This device will be developed with Arduino set up and will be controlled through a website interface.</p>

            <p>PROTOTYPE - STEPPER MOTOR WEEK: To develop the prototype's main intention to give the user to control the lights that creates the spatial environment, I designed the dial in such a way where it has a pointer that points to the desired quadrant/ mode which is connected to the stepper motor through ESP32 Board that is coded to precise number of steps for each quadrant. So the first quadrant: 'Focused' is at 25 steps from the origin; Second quadrant: 'Open awareness'is at 75 steps from the origin; Third quadrant: 'Creative flow' is at 125 steps from the origin and Fourth quadrant: 'Rest' is at 175 steps from the origin.</p>

            <p>PROTOTYPE - LED LIGHTS WEEK: To further develop the prototype to the lighting aspect of it, I connected 4 LED bulbs at particular pin locations: Red bulb - pin 4; Blue bulb - pin 5; Green bulb - pin 35 and White bulb - pin 36. By connecting these 4 bulbs at these locations we can code the Arduino to instruct to switch the LED's on when desired in accorance to the quadrants/ modes.</p>

            <h3>November 27, 2024</h3>
            <p>'THE MIND DIAL' WEEK: During this week I assembled the physical model of the prototype with the ESP32 board and the Arduino set up. Which completes the link between hard ware and software aspects of the device. Next I developed a website interface where the user with just a click of a button can choose the mode they desire to create for their journaling activity.</p>

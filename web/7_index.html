      <div class="description">one day i will go to sleep at a decent hour again, but not tonight. i am not doing what i said i would do yesterday. though as i wrote that i forgot what it was that i said i would do. i just reread saying that i would not clean. while that does sound tempting it might be more tempting for tomorrow considering i have work in the morning and it is likely to make my life easier if things are tidied up. i’m okay with that for tonight. luckily it doesn’t feel wildly messy by any means. just a few things on the table and some dishes mainly.</div>
       <p>i realize i also didn’t report back to what i did yesterday. i can clarify now—it may also be worth noting that i think this is the first time i am reflecting on the quality of my previous actions. anyways, i tidied the glass, label maker, phone, stapler, cat treats (though they are out again), bowl (also out again), scarf, bag (i forget which), power supply, napkin, paper bags, plastic bag, towel, cat bed, cat carrier, vacuum, laundry bag (somewhat the laundry is still in there, though it’s moved out the common space), laundry detergent, package, dishes, computer charger, notebooks, water bottle, alcohol wipes and tissues</p>  
      <p>i didn’t move: little rod’s present nor the extension cord</p>
    <p>as for today, to be tidied: cadaqués book, jon’s book, mouse, computer (maybe the first time i’ve noted since recording that it is an object to tend to), glass, bottle, back up drive, water bottle, bread in bag, bag on counter, jacket, dishes.</p>
    <p>
      that feels like plenty for now especially considering it’s nearly 12:30</p>

     <div class="description">this is the earliest i’ve started tidying since i began this practice. it’s not even 8:15 yet. i suppose that’s good because there’s actually a lot to tidy. it’s an interesting dynamic that tidying provides. especially the past few days, i’ve been really tired when it comes time to do it—in part in service of my wakeful, presumably energized self tomorrow. it suggests that i’m saving my ‘good energy’ for something more important than cleaning.</div> 
    <p>for the first time since i began listing the items, i’m going to have it serve as a guide today. the goal is not so much to have everything back in its place as much as to feel like things are tidied enough.</p>
    <p>i am curious as to what this threshold is and at what point i could reasonably stop and be satisfied. i assume it would occur far sooner than i imagine—in fact, i could not tidy at all. that’s an experiment for another day. that’s an action that if done in a certain way would perhaps require more attention than tidying. similarly, i’m curious as to how it would feel to abandon the line and return just to the list, or the initial iteration of the project: tidying in the dark. all things to perhaps give a shot…</p>
    <p>there are a few things that are off of the tidy line today and they’re all serviced by the same un-added line. part of me hesitates though, i like the circumambulatory nature of the track and if anything, at this moment, i’m tempted to remove the addition to the computer.</p>
    <p>to be tidied: glass, label maker, phone, mini stapler, cat treats, bowl, scarf, bag, power supply, napkin, paper bags, plastic bag, towel, cat bed, cat carrier, vacuum, laundry bag, laundry detergent, package, dishes, little rod’s birthday present, extension cord, computer charger, cat cone, notebooks, water bottle, alcohol wipes, tissues</p>

       <div class="description">it’s 20 minutes until 1 and i’m so tired. i don’t have much in me—just washing dishes and a quick preparation for tomorrow. luckily there’s not a ton to be done either. the vestibule could really use a tending to but while i want to say that’s not going to happen.</div>

       <div class="description">i photographed the line earlier today. considering it was rather difficult to assemble the first time around, i added colored dots in three varieties (yellow, green, blue) in a repeating pattern to help me construct the line more accurately and efficiently. i felt like a giant building a miniature village as i walked along it. i measured the space between each dot as one foot in front of the other (or perpendicular at corners and curves). i am curious to see if the dots will hold any importance as i navigate the line this evening. i am out of tape and feel stubborn enough that i will not use any another material, width, nor color of tape to extend the line in a desired direction. until i acquire the right one, i am stuck with my path.</div>
      <p>it worked well yesterday, granted it was three feet short from a comfortable reach, i managed to tidy that surface in the allotted space. as for today, there are some new things out that i’ve yet to decide what to do with—specifically a projector. there’s a fair amount of dishes and for the first time i am thinking it would be nice to be assisted in my endeavors.</p>
      <p>to be tidied: food bag in bag, water bottle, glasses, fabric, paper bag, projector, phone, bag, dishes.</p>

      <div class="description">the top priority of the tidy line is the same today as it was yesterday (D-access to the computer table). it is genuinely needed today in order to complete a good deal of tidying. i started to leave stuff in that area—a place that is usually consistent with it’s objects. i wonder if the anticipation of a sprawl allowed the perceived possibility of expansion. it could also be that i was rushed this morning and tried to do more things than i normally do. either way, i would like to tend to it. and the fact that it presented itself as top priority two days in a row warrants enough merit for me to execute it this evening. since d-line is an appendix, i’m not sure how i’m going to approach it in terms of movement. it will not be a part of the track like the other singular piece. maybe it serves as an option rather than the track. maybe i have to use it to determine it’s use.
      <p>to be tidied: 3 books, a tissue, tissue box, box cutter, mousepad, ESP32 & box, ipad, hard drive, water glass, dishes, charge headphones, toilet paper box, cereal box, new highlighters, turn off light by sewing machine (this is not on the track), move fabric, move computer charger, charge computer, charge phone, move glasses, wash dishes.</p>
      <p>i’ll start with the tape and then proceed. i laid the tape which is four feet shy of its intended terminus. today i will have to live with that. i also realized that this placement of the line is naturally an endpoint. i will start the tidy line as i have and instead of returning to my current position as i normally do, i will have the option for the journey to end there instead.</p>

          <div class="description">of course it is just my luck that i have already tidied the thing that the top priority line would be laid for. nonetheless i will add it along the way. there isn’t too much to be tidied now, so it goes often on the day when i’m home for a while. perhaps i will opt instead for a closet or computer line instead of the cat bowl one. this line will also be dictated by the amount of tape i have, which is not much. yesterday when i made the diagram, the priority was reflected purely by the circumstances. the order today has changed. today’s priority is (1) D, (2) B, (3) C, (4) E, (5) A. i will wait at least one more day and average the priority before laying the line.
          <p>to be tidied: bag elements sprawled on the table, sweatshirt, esp32, books, notebooks, pillow, folder, pen, highlighter, receipt, aloe vera, matches, label maker, back up disk, get reading from printer. </p>

        <div class="description">a good deal of things to tidy. i couldn’t do much yesterday and i’m feeling the consequences now. feeling generally discouraged at the moment or in other words—tired.
          <p>to be tidied: cup, bowl, socks, sweater, t shirt, laundry, cough drops, boxes in vestibule, sunscreen, things from work, fix pillows on chair, fix pillows on couch, wrapper, towel, make bed, glasses, dishes, cat water, books, pheromones, cat toys, paper bag.</p>
          <p>something just occurred to me while tidying (cup, bowl, socks, sweater, t shirt, cough drops, boxes, sunscreen, pillows on couch and chairs, wrapper, towel, glasses, dishes, books, cat toys and the paper bag): i can alter this line. today is day 6 of this practice. each day, after i tidied that which bordered the line, there was either more to tend to that was not done or was completed after. the things that cannot presently be tended to online are: laundry bags, socks, t shirt, sweaters, cough drops, pheromones. i stepped offline to put away cat toys and my computer which i then immediately reopened after this realization.</p>
          <p>i adjusted the tidy line with lines that would be helpful in order of highest to lowest priority. (1) A access to duane’s food bowl—it needn’t extend deep into the room, just enough for access; (2) B access to the closest—the deeper the better but at the very least the line would go deep enough for me to be able to place things on the usm or around the bend of the wall; (3)  C access to the bathroom—this could be just to the threshold, i have long arms; (4) D access to the computer table; (5) E access to my class notebooks and materials.</p>
          <p>as i listed the items above, i changed a few things around imagining what would make the most of my tidying experience. where i would not have to extend myself as i did on monday and tuesday. i chose not to include the toilet room, as i thought of it i realized that this line is an indicator of work and focus. i tend to myself before and after but very rarely during, despite it being a relaxing activity most of the time…these are all things to take into consideration for tomorrow’s session.</p>

      <div class="description">so tired i’m not feeling capable of much. i think only once, maybe twice before have i decided to not tidy everything that i can think of. today it will just be a walk and a wash. i would like to wash my glass and otherwise go to sleep.
        <p>to be tidied: water glass</p>

      <div class="description">yesterday was the first day i didn’t tidy. i worked late and didn’t get home until 1 am. it’s crumby to give an excuse and not worth it. ultimately, it didn’t happen. i am having more feelings about this than i expected. it’s just past 1130 now, i got home an hour and a half ago, i started tidying because things were amess. then came to the computer to continue but ultimately paused now for a good while. i feel a bit ashamed that i didn’t do it yesterday. not so much in the context of the class (though partly) but even more that it has become a routine that incites a grounding at the end of the day—even when rooted in the absurdity of the tidy line. in this case, breaking a promise to myself feels like a small failure and makes me slightly unmotivated to continue. just the right time to keep going.
        <p>to be tidied: water bottle, books, new tissue box, chips, glass on table, sauce on table, charge phones, move cat food, wash dishes, take herbs, clear counters, chocolate, put away herbs, pillows, things in my bag.</p>
        <p>i noticed that the past two times were the only times that i checked back to the list. i did so after i finished the track and returned to the computer. aside from those two days, every day since i have pursued this action i missed something. i did not take the time to take not of it as i ended my computer time as i held the mental image of the list in my head—though apparently not all that effectively. </p>
        <p>i just tidied, i spent a lot of time on dishes and veered from the line. as i am tired i am finding some justification of rule bending. i feel less committed to following the exact order of the process despite being pleased with its outcome. to my surprise i completed all of the tasks without referring back to the list. i wonder if there is a relationship between these two things: in a lack of accurate execution, do i make up for it by paying better attention to the task at hand? does it help with the rules are slightly bent? does it accommodate a personalized attention? how to emotions affect attention? which kinds of attentions are cultivated within varying emotional landscapes?</p>

       <div class="description">i’m beyond tired and feel i can only do one track. one back one forth, so two. i will clear out my bag and prepare somewhat for tomorrow. it’s nearly 1230 and it feels absurd to do it in this manner. what if i didn’t do it perfectly but just did something?
        <p>to be tidied: water bottle, towel,  bags, pants, charge phone, recycle tissue box.</p>
        <p>i forgot to time myself but i think it’s about 14 minutes. in addition to the list, i did the dishes. i started writing at 1216 and did so for not more than two minutes. a small goal felt easy enough and i did it, while still following the line.</p>

      <div class="day-report">
        <div class="date">23 SEPT 2024</div>
       <div class="description">i just created a track for myself. i have yet to veer from it. it made it nearly impossible for me to get my computer just now. i had to reach and lean—in the making of the track i hadn’t accommodated for that which i might need.
        <p>i intentionally set it prior to list making as i didn’t want to intentionally make it easier for myself. the parameter for the line, i must continue from end to end on the line. no turning back unless at a terminus, of which there are two. one by the door and one by the couch. i will take pictures of the line after i finish tidying as i am currently seated on the couch, my feet atop the terminus. the line is structured as follows: couch, off rug, around chair, past book shelf, hard right left table, and another, straight, looped around the counter, pass other half of bookshelf, back around the couch-facing side of the table, gentle left into the vestibule, ends approximately 2 feet from the front door.</p>
        <p>to tidy: papers on dining table, mouse pad (this will be a difficult reach), notebook, tape dispenser, paper model, book on table, book on couch, magazine on counter, ipad keyboard, bread bag, pill case, scarf and hat, towel (this might only be possible if i am lying on the floor), olfa knife in bag (remove packaging and bring to respective bins), fill mason jar with  laundry sanitizer, sweep kitchen, move old litter box to bring to street. </p>
        <p>i cannot tidy anything in the bathroom nor bedroom, i did not make a path for them, luckily the only thing i see in the bathroom that needs tending to is the shower curtain, which i might be able to manage if i lie on the floor beside the cat water bowl.</p>
        <p>track one done in 5 min 33 sec. i actually got far more done than i expected. some of which wasn’t include in the initial list. i removed the book and notebook from my bag and replaced them to their area (albeit on my knees). i recycled the model. moved the tape dispenser. filled the jar. moved the litter box. moved the magazine, and book on couch. i tried to move the ipad keyboard and with a gentle toss completely missed the intended surface. since i could only go in one direction per track, i found myself carrying far more in one go than i normally do.</p>
        <p>still to be done: mouse pad, papers on table, red notebook, book on table (will stay), bread bag, pill case, scarf and hat, towel, olfa knife & packaging, sweep kitchen.</p>
        <p>this time took longer, 8 min 32 sec.  i found myself a lot more aware of trying to do as much as i could in one go. i had to hold objects for a lot longer in order to bring them to their correct point. for nearly the entire walk i was balancing a bowl of mostly eaten cat food atop a mouse pad atop a book. i nearly turned around in the vestibule but stopped myself and resorted to skillfully tossing the olfa a few inches of its typical spot.</p>
        <p>in the course i gave myself, i included quite a few hard turns, two that i wrote of initially and was aware of. but almost every other, unless sufficiently elongated heightened my attention to my feet and the odd placement. for the most part i am walking along the line one foot in front of the other. unless  i am paused, intersecting the line perpendicularly.</p>
        <p>i thought i would be able to reach the bathroom but as soon as i passed in on the first round it was pretty certainly out of reach. perhaps this round i’ll give a go at the things that are out of reach and dishes too, which will be odd standing at least a foot and a half from the sink.</p>
        <p>otherwise, i tidied: papers on the table, mouse pad, cat food (in compost, bowl is still on counter), snack bag and trash contents, filled tomorrow’s supplements, olfa, book on the table (now on the coffee table). </p>
        <p>i forgot the pill case in my bag and to sweep.</p>
        <p>so this round: start by adjusting the towel, move the cat bowl into the sink and attempt to wash dishes,* grab the pill case, sweep, try moving the shower curtain.*perhaps worth noting: i just closed my eyes to imagine myself navigating the path to make sure i’m doing this in the most efficient way.</p>
        <p>that was the longest yet: 11 min 57 sec. i successfully completed most things with the addition of moving the ipad keyboard and mousepad onto their correct shelves and with the exception of fully adjusting the shower curtain (i was able to close it with ~6 in of shower still exposed). it was a real feat to move the curtain, i had only a single toe on the line and could barely reach the curtain as i splayed myself across the bathroom floor.that action along with the dishwashing highlighted my height. to wash the dishes, i leant my elbows on the lip of the sink and bent myself in an L shape. while not terribly uncomfortable, i found myself feeling grateful to all the other times i choose to wash dishes standing upright.</p>
        <p>all i initially wished to tidy and more have been completed and rather successfully i would say. the entire experience was enjoyable, i am unsure of how much to attribute to the novelty of abiding by a line. i’m fairly certain, however, i will not frequently choose to attempt to adjust the shower curtain while belly-down and pulling myself in either direction. though there is a particular enjoyment of rolling on the floor that i don’t often do and this situation invited a new interaction with the ground.</p>
        <p>the central most interaction of space was the ping-ponging between termini. doing so forced me to pay more attention to the order in which i completed tasks and even when i did i ended up holding a whole suite of things with me along the way. aside from the last go, i would estimate i spent no less than 85% of the time with an object in hand.</p>

        <div class="description">lots more things to take care of today, the collection of objects are reflective of how much time i spent at home today. especially in comparison to other days as of late. i touched many things today. i cooked, i worked, i read, i drew, i sliced, i labeled, i vacuumed, i washed.
            <p>and now things to tend to: my book, open drawer, spare glasses, laundry bag (i didn’t take care of that last night), replug cat pheromones—living room, replug cat pheromones bedroom, label maker by books, t shirt on body, aluminum foil experiment somewhere safe, recycle votive holder, clean counter tops, replace pencil, put away kicker, replace chair, move glasses shammy, paper on the floor, wooden bowl of pegs, clear off secondary kitchen counter, wipe off stove.</p>
            <p>the easiest things to tend to are the things within my view from the couch. there are things in the kitchen i can’t see well, especially since i am not wearing my glasses. i am similarly having a hard time imagining what is out of place around the corner, on that counter, i have an idea: a small box of small staples, eight push pins in a narrow container, a roll of kraft tape, a magazine, a piece of mail, a new pen. time to check.</p>
            <p>i missed: a small spritzing bottle of water, a tube of hand cream, a spare spray, probiotics, toner, a roll of orange velcro, a sleeve of cough drops</p>

        <p>i see that normally when i start a list it’s not a chaotic looking bouncing from place to place but i mentally gather the objects in their already designated areas. typically starting with what’s closest to me: socks, towel, earphones, water, book, fuzz. straight ahead (from surface towards floor) : nut butters, vitamin c, supplements, papers, paper bag. in the distance to my right: box, jar, bottle, duvet. pillows are actually next to me but the duvet reminded me of the pillows being adjusted since technically they are behind me at the moment. this remembrance reoriented me to things i had previously glossed over or were occluded by my computer: book, computer. back to the distance: plastic bag, sweater. to my left: chair cushions → reminded me of the chair to my right which needs adjusting as well. general space: lights. unattended space: candle. completely out of view: dishes.</p></div>

        <div class="description">an intention-less un-affordance this evening. i feel under the weather. after 2+ hours of commuting, orientation, laundry, acupuncture, laundry again, and some work i am absolutely wiped. i feel emotionally and physically unmotivated. in fact i feel restrained, i stopped myself from doing the dishes so i could write about it first. so i could do it intentionally. isn’t that something. in a way, that implies that i am more committed to the practice of the intention than the action itself. well to continue the practice in the face of discomfort, the things to be tidied are:
            <p>pants on the chair, teacup, glass, wrapper, hair clip, book, towel, tissues, make bed, laundry bags, wash dishes, pantry groceries, spray bottle, kitchen towels, sweet potatoes, duvet cover, duvet, cat bowls (food & water)</p>
            <p>i'm thinking about how this action of tidying is an invitation to lead me through the main arteries of my apartment. how could this movement be recorded? i find myself focusing using the items as landmarks for my movement. i am noticing now that the majority of tidying exists in moving back and forth between things. i become beholden to the current and correct location of the items.</p></div>

        <div class="description">in hindsight, perhaps the most successful part of the intervention of monday and tuesday was noting what needed to be tidied before hand, despite it not being the intended goal. i tacked it on yesterday after doing it on monday as a way to gear up to complete the action. it gave me a sense of purpose whilst navigating the space. it also took me out of the typical horseshoe habit of bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, vestibule (or the inverse).
        <p>in previous iterations of tidying it was aimless and would take longer than this rather efficient method of identifying what needs to be done.</p>    </div>
        <p>in reflection, i just realized that the initial list making in both instances was done while the lights were still on. this is important because it give me a moment to survey the space. the survey and understanding of what needs to be done is most easily accomplished when the visual field is accessible. this coupled with taking action in the dark makes for a much more productive and enjoyable experience.</p>
        <p>i’m writing here something completely unrelated. i don't expect anyone to read all of what i’ve written. considering this is an exercise in attention i wonder if anyone will notice. if you do, say something?</p>
        <p>it is best understood when compared to last 10 or 13 september, both of which were done in the dark. both of which were pleasurable. there is a particular enjoyment that occurs while navigating a space in a colorless void.  one could say it affords relaxation. anyways, those two previous iterations while enjoyable were more based in spatial exploration where as listing defines the parameters and anchors the process.</p>

        <div class="description">yesterday went well. i am tired and i'm going to go again now with the same interventions. music, candles, lights off.
       <p>things to be tidied: towel, pillows, computer case, computer, tea pot, papers, dishes, mousepad, wallet, park water for freezing, shoes, food bag for tomorrow, kitchen counter, mouse instructions, clothing.</p>
       <p>i did the things, it went quickly. i forgot to put the towel and book actually. i see it now that i’m sitting. i will do it when i get up. even though i’m tired, doing it was a nice way to wind down and also prepare for tomorrow. i feel like i didn’t do that as much as i could have last night and felt the effects this morning.</p>

        <div class="description">i have cleaned everyday since i established my practice but i have not journaled about it thoroughly each day. there have been a few days when i have been tired and tidying is the farthest thing from what i would like to do. yet i do it. the appreciation usually comes the following day, it doesn’t feel like a particular glory at the time of execution.
        <p>i find that what i'm often looking for is a sense of calmness through tidying, that turning off the lights may be of benefit and choosing then to tidy by candlelight. of course this practically  makes it more difficult—but it makes it more enjoyable and furthers the intimacy of the action as well as the initial intention.</p>
        <p>as for now, there is a smattering of things i would like to tidy: an empty cup of tea, a book on the floor, various papers on the table, cat ear cleaner by the record player, a reusable bag on the counter, spritzing water for plants, dishes, reorienting the chairs, a lone shirt, writing utensils, yoga blocks, computer charger, cat toy, nasal spray, spare glasses, extra blanket, two pillows, foot wakers, bread pans, reusable bag from today’s bread, today’s notebook.</p>
        <p>naming this items in succession feels both over- and underwhelming. i'm sure i will end up tidying more than this. i wonder if going in with a plan can also be considered an affordance…it is worth considering. tomorrow i can turn off the lights. perhaps i’ll do the candle thing tonight too though.</p>
        <p>i cleaned for about 30 minutes by candlelight with a bit of music. while practically, cleaning with the lights off is likely to limit the affordance of the action, which of course it did—particularly when sweeping the kitchen—it did enhance the purpose of the activity, to calm down, reset, unwind, etc. the inability to see fully the dishes i was washing afforded me to pay even closer attention, to handle the objects with care and to confuse the lid from a cat food can with the end of a kiwifruit.</p>
        <p>it afforded a curiosity not towards the objects themselves as much as it afforded the ability to slow down. the music is likely to be influential as well—i’ve been listening to emahoy tsegué-maryam guèbrou. overall i would call the intervention largely successful.</p>
        <p>it may also be noted, that i didn't fully complete the list, i have yet to: move the spritzing bottle, the computer charger, foot wakers, nor today’s bread bag. though additionally, i tidied: the vestibule, the countertops, the dining table, the coffee table, the vestibule. swept the kitchen and litter box areas. brushed my teeth, washed my face, and prepared myself for bed.</p>
        <p>as i mentioned before, listing out the things i wanted to do made me feel overwhelmed initially. midway through cleaning, however, i found myself comfortably reminded by my desires and the preemptive list actually grounded my actions.</p>

        <div class="description">for today's intervention i set a timer for 15 minutes. the boundary of time made me more productive and more focused though the experience of it was less enjoyable, the result was just as satisfying. i tidied for longer than 15 minutes, in fact it was for nearly 30. i found myself anxious, attempting to do everything within the bounds of the timer. i was more activated after doing it than i was before. i wouldn’t define this as particularly unenjoyable, but it wasn’t pleasant either. considering that my goal is to wind down and reconnect with myself and my space i would say that this is counter productive. this practice, at least for today, distanced me from myself and made me feel like a worker in my home.</div>

        <div class="description">jon and i tidied at the same time while conversing. this was the most enjoyable of them all. as we were speaking of our days the sorting of objects became both physical and conversational. it became a moment of connection with him and reconnection with myself and home.</div>

       <div class="description">i’m beyond tired and feel i can only do one track. one back one forth, so two. i will clear out my bag and prepare somewhat for tomorrow. it’s nearly 1230 and it feels absurd to do it in this manner. what if i didn’t do it perfectly but just did something?
        <p>to be tidied: water bottle, towel,  bags, pants, charge phone, recycle tissue box.</p>
        <p>i forgot to time myself but i think it’s about 14 minutes. in addition to the list, i did the dishes. i started writing at 1216 and did so for not more than two minutes. a small goal felt easy enough and i did it, while still following the line.</p>
      </div>
         </div>  
      <div class="day-report">
        <div class="date">23 SEPT 2024</div>
       <div class="description">i just created a track for myself. i have yet to veer from it. it made it nearly impossible for me to get my computer just now. i had to reach and lean—in the making of the track i hadn’t accommodated for that which i might need.
        <p>i intentionally set it prior to list making as i didn’t want to intentionally make it easier for myself. the parameter for the line, i must continue from end to end on the line. no turning back unless at a terminus, of which there are two. one by the door and one by the couch. i will take pictures of the line after i finish tidying as i am currently seated on the couch, my feet atop the terminus. the line is structured as follows: couch, off rug, around chair, past book shelf, hard right left table, and another, straight, looped around the counter, pass other half of bookshelf, back around the couch-facing side of the table, gentle left into the vestibule, ends approximately 2 feet from the front door.</p>
        <p>to tidy: papers on dining table, mouse pad (this will be a difficult reach), notebook, tape dispenser, paper model, book on table, book on couch, magazine on counter, ipad keyboard, bread bag, pill case, scarf and hat, towel (this might only be possible if i am lying on the floor), olfa knife in bag (remove packaging and bring to respective bins), fill mason jar with  laundry sanitizer, sweep kitchen, move old litter box to bring to street. </p>
        <p>i cannot tidy anything in the bathroom nor bedroom, i did not make a path for them, luckily the only thing i see in the bathroom that needs tending to is the shower curtain, which i might be able to manage if i lie on the floor beside the cat water bowl.</p>
        <p>track one done in 5 min 33 sec. i actually got far more done than i expected. some of which wasn’t include in the initial list. i removed the book and notebook from my bag and replaced them to their area (albeit on my knees). i recycled the model. moved the tape dispenser. filled the jar. moved the litter box. moved the magazine, and book on couch. i tried to move the ipad keyboard and with a gentle toss completely missed the intended surface. since i could only go in one direction per track, i found myself carrying far more in one go than i normally do.</p>
        <p>still to be done: mouse pad, papers on table, red notebook, book on table (will stay), bread bag, pill case, scarf and hat, towel, olfa knife & packaging, sweep kitchen.</p>
        <p>this time took longer, 8 min 32 sec.  i found myself a lot more aware of trying to do as much as i could in one go. i had to hold objects for a lot longer in order to bring them to their correct point. for nearly the entire walk i was balancing a bowl of mostly eaten cat food atop a mouse pad atop a book. i nearly turned around in the vestibule but stopped myself and resorted to skillfully tossing the olfa a few inches of its typical spot.</p>
        <p>in the course i gave myself, i included quite a few hard turns, two that i wrote of initially and was aware of. but almost every other, unless sufficiently elongated heightened my attention to my feet and the odd placement. for the most part i am walking along the line one foot in front of the other. unless  i am paused, intersecting the line perpendicularly.</p>
        <p>i thought i would be able to reach the bathroom but as soon as i passed in on the first round it was pretty certainly out of reach. perhaps this round i’ll give a go at the things that are out of reach and dishes too, which will be odd standing at least a foot and a half from the sink.</p>
        <p>otherwise, i tidied: papers on the table, mouse pad, cat food (in compost, bowl is still on counter), snack bag and trash contents, filled tomorrow’s supplements, olfa, book on the table (now on the coffee table). </p>
        <p>i forgot the pill case in my bag and to sweep.</p>
        <p>so this round: start by adjusting the towel, move the cat bowl into the sink and attempt to wash dishes,* grab the pill case, sweep, try moving the shower curtain.*perhaps worth noting: i just closed my eyes to imagine myself navigating the path to make sure i’m doing this in the most efficient way.</p>
        <p>that was the longest yet: 11 min 57 sec. i successfully completed most things with the addition of moving the ipad keyboard and mousepad onto their correct shelves and with the exception of fully adjusting the shower curtain (i was able to close it with ~6 in of shower still exposed). it was a real feat to move the curtain, i had only a single toe on the line and could barely reach the curtain as i splayed myself across the bathroom floor.that action along with the dishwashing highlighted my height. to wash the dishes, i leant my elbows on the lip of the sink and bent myself in an L shape. while not terribly uncomfortable, i found myself feeling grateful to all the other times i choose to wash dishes standing upright.</p>
        <p>all i initially wished to tidy and more have been completed and rather successfully i would say. the entire experience was enjoyable, i am unsure of how much to attribute to the novelty of abiding by a line. i’m fairly certain, however, i will not frequently choose to attempt to adjust the shower curtain while belly-down and pulling myself in either direction. though there is a particular enjoyment of rolling on the floor that i don’t often do and this situation invited a new interaction with the ground.</p>
        <p>the central most interaction of space was the ping-ponging between termini. doing so forced me to pay more attention to the order in which i completed tasks and even when i did i ended up holding a whole suite of things with me along the way. aside from the last go, i would estimate i spent no less than 85% of the time with an object in hand.</p>

        <div class="description">lots more things to take care of today, the collection of objects are reflective of how much time i spent at home today. especially in comparison to other days as of late. i touched many things today. i cooked, i worked, i read, i drew, i sliced, i labeled, i vacuumed, i washed.
            <p>and now things to tend to: my book, open drawer, spare glasses, laundry bag (i didn’t take care of that last night), replug cat pheromones—living room, replug cat pheromones bedroom, label maker by books, t shirt on body, aluminum foil experiment somewhere safe, recycle votive holder, clean counter tops, replace pencil, put away kicker, replace chair, move glasses shammy, paper on the floor, wooden bowl of pegs, clear off secondary kitchen counter, wipe off stove.</p>
            <p>the easiest things to tend to are the things within my view from the couch. there are things in the kitchen i can’t see well, especially since i am not wearing my glasses. i am similarly having a hard time imagining what is out of place around the corner, on that counter, i have an idea: a small box of small staples, eight push pins in a narrow container, a roll of kraft tape, a magazine, a piece of mail, a new pen. time to check.</p>
            <p>i missed: a small spritzing bottle of water, a tube of hand cream, a spare spray, probiotics, toner, a roll of orange velcro, a sleeve of cough drops</p>

        <p>i see that normally when i start a list it’s not a chaotic looking bouncing from place to place but i mentally gather the objects in their already designated areas. typically starting with what’s closest to me: socks, towel, earphones, water, book, fuzz. straight ahead (from surface towards floor) : nut butters, vitamin c, supplements, papers, paper bag. in the distance to my right: box, jar, bottle, duvet. pillows are actually next to me but the duvet reminded me of the pillows being adjusted since technically they are behind me at the moment. this remembrance reoriented me to things i had previously glossed over or were occluded by my computer: book, computer. back to the distance: plastic bag, sweater. to my left: chair cushions → reminded me of the chair to my right which needs adjusting as well. general space: lights. unattended space: candle. completely out of view: dishes.</p></div>

        <div class="description">an intention-less un-affordance this evening. i feel under the weather. after 2+ hours of commuting, orientation, laundry, acupuncture, laundry again, and some work i am absolutely wiped. i feel emotionally and physically unmotivated. in fact i feel restrained, i stopped myself from doing the dishes so i could write about it first. so i could do it intentionally. isn’t that something. in a way, that implies that i am more committed to the practice of the intention than the action itself. well to continue the practice in the face of discomfort, the things to be tidied are:
            <p>pants on the chair, teacup, glass, wrapper, hair clip, book, towel, tissues, make bed, laundry bags, wash dishes, pantry groceries, spray bottle, kitchen towels, sweet potatoes, duvet cover, duvet, cat bowls (food & water)</p>
            <p>i'm thinking about how this action of tidying is an invitation to lead me through the main arteries of my apartment. how could this movement be recorded? i find myself focusing using the items as landmarks for my movement. i am noticing now that the majority of tidying exists in moving back and forth between things. i become beholden to the current and correct location of the items.</p></div>

        <div class="description">i am tired from a long day and have been avoiding sleep, it’s 9pm now and probably a good time to wind down. i’m going to note what needs to be tidied before doing 15 minutes of work, tidying, then shower, then sleep.</div>
        <p>to be tidied: empty bottle, vitamin c, new book, tissues, paper towels, break down boxes, clear out bag for tomorrow, reset pillows, clean cat food and water bowls, socks.</p>
        <p>somewhat unexpected is that the more attention i pay to tidying, the less there seems to be done each day.</p>

        <div class="date">18 SEPT 2024</div>
        <div class="description">in hindsight, perhaps the most successful part of the intervention of monday and tuesday was noting what needed to be tidied before hand, despite it not being the intended goal. i tacked it on yesterday after doing it on monday as a way to gear up to complete the action. it gave me a sense of purpose whilst navigating the space. it also took me out of the typical horseshoe habit of bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, vestibule (or the inverse).
        <p>in previous iterations of tidying it was aimless and would take longer than this rather efficient method of identifying what needs to be done.</p>    </div>
        <p>in reflection, i just realized that the initial list making in both instances was done while the lights were still on. this is important because it give me a moment to survey the space. the survey and understanding of what needs to be done is most easily accomplished when the visual field is accessible. this coupled with taking action in the dark makes for a much more productive and enjoyable experience.</p>
        <p>i’m writing here something completely unrelated. i don't expect anyone to read all of what i’ve written. considering this is an exercise in attention i wonder if anyone will notice. if you do, say something?</p>
        <p>it is best understood when compared to last 10 or 13 september, both of which were done in the dark. both of which were pleasurable. there is a particular enjoyment that occurs while navigating a space in a colorless void.  one could say it affords relaxation. anyways, those two previous iterations while enjoyable were more based in spatial exploration where as listing defines the parameters and anchors the process.</p>

        <div class="description">yesterday went well. i am tired and i'm going to go again now with the same interventions. music, candles, lights off.
       <p>things to be tidied: towel, pillows, computer case, computer, tea pot, papers, dishes, mousepad, wallet, park water for freezing, shoes, food bag for tomorrow, kitchen counter, mouse instructions, clothing.</p>
       <p>i did the things, it went quickly. i forgot to put the towel and book actually. i see it now that i’m sitting. i will do it when i get up. even though i’m tired, doing it was a nice way to wind down and also prepare for tomorrow. i feel like i didn’t do that as much as i could have last night and felt the effects this morning.</p>

      <div class="day-report">
        <div class="date">16 SEPT 2024</div>
        <div class="description">i have cleaned everyday since i established my practice but i have not journaled about it thoroughly each day. there have been a few days when i have been tired and tidying is the farthest thing from what i would like to do. yet i do it. the appreciation usually comes the following day, it doesn’t feel like a particular glory at the time of execution.
        <p>i find that what i'm often looking for is a sense of calmness through tidying, that turning off the lights may be of benefit and choosing then to tidy by candlelight. of course this practically  makes it more difficult—but it makes it more enjoyable and furthers the intimacy of the action as well as the initial intention.</p>
        <p>as for now, there is a smattering of things i would like to tidy: an empty cup of tea, a book on the floor, various papers on the table, cat ear cleaner by the record player, a reusable bag on the counter, spritzing water for plants, dishes, reorienting the chairs, a lone shirt, writing utensils, yoga blocks, computer charger, cat toy, nasal spray, spare glasses, extra blanket, two pillows, foot wakers, bread pans, reusable bag from today’s bread, today’s notebook.</p>
        <p>naming this items in succession feels both over- and underwhelming. i'm sure i will end up tidying more than this. i wonder if going in with a plan can also be considered an affordance…it is worth considering. tomorrow i can turn off the lights. perhaps i’ll do the candle thing tonight too though.</p>
        <p>i cleaned for about 30 minutes by candlelight with a bit of music. while practically, cleaning with the lights off is likely to limit the affordance of the action, which of course it did—particularly when sweeping the kitchen—it did enhance the purpose of the activity, to calm down, reset, unwind, etc. the inability to see fully the dishes i was washing afforded me to pay even closer attention, to handle the objects with care and to confuse the lid from a cat food can with the end of a kiwifruit.</p>
        <p>it afforded a curiosity not towards the objects themselves as much as it afforded the ability to slow down. the music is likely to be influential as well—i’ve been listening to emahoy tsegué-maryam guèbrou. overall i would call the intervention largely successful.</p>
        <p>it may also be noted, that i didn't fully complete the list, i have yet to: move the spritzing bottle, the computer charger, foot wakers, nor today’s bread bag. though additionally, i tidied: the vestibule, the countertops, the dining table, the coffee table, the vestibule. swept the kitchen and litter box areas. brushed my teeth, washed my face, and prepared myself for bed.</p>
        <p>as i mentioned before, listing out the things i wanted to do made me feel overwhelmed initially. midway through cleaning, however, i found myself comfortably reminded by my desires and the preemptive list actually grounded my actions.</p>

        <div class="description">for today's intervention i set a timer for 15 minutes. the boundary of time made me more productive and more focused though the experience of it was less enjoyable, the result was just as satisfying. i tidied for longer than 15 minutes, in fact it was for nearly 30. i found myself anxious, attempting to do everything within the bounds of the timer. i was more activated after doing it than i was before. i wouldn’t define this as particularly unenjoyable, but it wasn’t pleasant either. considering that my goal is to wind down and reconnect with myself and my space i would say that this is counter productive. this practice, at least for today, distanced me from myself and made me feel like a worker in my home.</div>

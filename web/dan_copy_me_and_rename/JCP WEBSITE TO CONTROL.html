        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An attentional artifact that provides the user different attentional modes to facilitate focus, relaxation, and creative thinking while journaling by setting the environment's lighting to the user's choice of attention level. This innovative device can be programmed to adjust the lighting based on the user's preferences and needs, creating a personalized and conducive atmosphere for journaling. Additionally, the attentional artifact can also be synced with music or ambient sounds to further enhance the user's experience and productivity.

        <h3>Attentional Theory: "Attention as an Ecological Environment"</h3>
        <p>
Our attention is not a static resource to be managed, but rather a dynamic environment that may be purposefully cultivated and changed. This attentional artifact views attention as an ecological ecosystem - a living, dynamic system that may be softly touched rather than forcefully manipulated. 
This artifact posits that attention, like environments, is a complex interconnected system that responds to modest interventions. 

Lighting and sound modulations serve as environmental cues that invite and suggest rather than compel attention. They create a meta-context in which attention can naturally settle, stray, or focus, much to how natural settings gradually regulate biological processes. The user does not actively manage attention, but rather creates conditions in which focused or creative attention can emerge organically.
This viewpoint sees attention as intrinsically relational - not something held, but something experienced in dialog with one's surroundings. The artifact functions as a responsive interface between internal cognitive processes and external environmental stimuli, enabling a more fluid and responsive understanding of attentional experience. 

By offering unique, adaptive environmental configurations, the artifact implies that attention is a collaborative process: part purposeful direction, half responsive emergence, and always in dynamic interaction with its surroundings. 

The fundamental principle is cultivation of attentional ecology, which entails building generative places in which various modes of focus, creativity, and contemplation can organically emerge.

        <h3>Attentional Theory: "Attention as an Ecological Environment"</h3>
        <p>
          Our attention is not a static resource to be managed, but rather a dynamic environment that may be purposefully cultivated and changed. This attentional artifact views attention as an ecological ecosystem - a living, dynamic system that may be softly touched rather than forcefully manipulated. This artifact posits that attention, like environments, is a complex interconnected system that responds to modest interventions. Light modulations serve as environmental cues that invite and suggest rather than compel attention. They create a meta-context in which attention can naturally settle, stray, or focus, much to how natural settings gradually regulate biological processes. This viewpoint sees attention as intrinsically relational - not something held, but something experienced in dialog with one's surroundings. The artifact functions as a responsive interface between internal cognitive processes and external environmental stimuli, enabling a more fluid and responsive understanding of attentional experience. The fundamental principle is cultivation of attentional ecology, which entails building generative places in which various modes of focus, creativity, and contemplation can organically emerge.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This project creates a tool designed to enhance focus during writing through feedback. As the user writes, the tool highlights the text with light and provides verbal feedback after each completed sentence. If the user pauses for too long, reverse feedback encourages them to continue, fostering a deeper connection with their writing process. By integrating visual and auditory cues, the tool serves as a silent yet supportive guide, helping the user maintain flow and concentration.</p>

        <p>This tool is designed for the time I spend in the evening reflecting on the day's thoughts and organizing my plans for the next day. It typically takes place at my desk, where I create a dim, quiet environment by turning off most of the lights, including the desk lamp and other surrounding lights, to foster a focused atmosphere.</p>

          <h3>Attentional Theory</h3>
          <p>
            This project is based on the idea that feedback plays a crucial role in maintaining attention and improving focus. From my own experiences, I have found that engaging with a task becomes significantly easier when I receive feedback about my actions. For example, when exercising, focusing on the movement of muscles helps me concentrate better, and having someone nearby to count repetitions or provide encouragement can enhance the effectiveness of the workout. Similarly, when children are learning, a parent’s affirmations or supportive comments can reinforce their attention. In contrast, tasks performed in isolation, without external feedback, often lead to distractions. In these moments, my mind tends to wander, whether it’s counting the grains of wood on my desk or imagining unrelated thoughts.

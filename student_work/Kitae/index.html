        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This project aims to create a tool that maintains and enhances focus during writing. 
          As users write, the tool highlights the writing area with light and reads completed sentences aloud, 
          providing real-time feedback. This fosters deeper awareness of the user’s thoughts and actions, 
          keeping them engaged with their writing process.</p>

        <h3>Attentional Theory</h3>
        <p>
          This project aims to redefine the relationship between users and their attention by fostering an environment of continuous 
self-reflection and interactive feedback within the writing process. Attention is not merely about staying focused on a task; 
it is about actively engaging with one’s thoughts, actions, and progress. By integrating auditory and visual cues, 
the tool creates a feedback-rich ecosystem that reinforces sustained concentration while encouraging reflective thinking.

⊙ Self-Reflection
One key aspect of the project is its emphasis on self-reflection. 
The act of hearing one’s written sentences read aloud transforms writing from a solitary action into an interactive experience. 
This auditory feedback helps users step back and perceive their thoughts from a new perspective, 
promoting deeper cognitive engagement. For instance, when a sentence is read aloud, users may notice nuances, terrors, 
or gaps in their reasoning that might otherwise go unnoticed. This externalization of their inner dialogue serves as 
a moment of self-assessment, strengthening their connection to the task at hand and encouraging iterative improvement.

⊙ Interactive Feedback Loop
The feedback loop between the user and the tool is both dynamic and supportive. 
Visual feedback, such as light focused on the area where the user is currently writing, provides an immediate 
and intuitive connection to their physical actions. Simultaneously, auditory feedback in the form of spoken sentences reaffirms 
their progress and creates a sense of dialogue with the tool. This bidirectional interaction mirrors conversational learning, 
where validation and responses enhance focus and motivation. The tool effectively acts as a collaborative partner, 
helping users remain grounded in their task while continuously adapting to their pace and behavior.

⊙ Sustained Focus
By integrating these feedback mechanisms, the tool helps users maintain a sustained focus that is self-aware 
and resistant to external distractions. Unlike traditional methods of concentration that rely solely on willpower, 
this approach uses positive reinforcement to anchor attention. The lighting draws the user’s gaze back to 
the writing surface, while the auditory playback re-engages their thought process. Together, these elements 
create a holistic attentional system that aligns the user’s physical actions, cognitive efforts, and reflective thoughts, 
transforming writing into an immersive and fulfilling experience.

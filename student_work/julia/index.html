        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>My attentional theory views wakefulness as a dynamic interplay of physical 
          balance and creative expression. Attention becomes a creative instrument, 
          shaped by the conditions of the body and environment, fostering mindfulness 
          and spontaneity. By replacing hurried routines with intentional engagement, 
          my project transforms wakefulness into a practice of balance, exploration, 
          and attunement to the present moment.</p>

        <h3>Attentional Theory</h3>
        <p>
          My relationship to attention, particularly in the context of wakefulness, 
          is evolving from a reactive to a generative practice. Traditionally, 
          my attention has been kickstarted by external stimulants like coffee or 
          the lyrical drama of Erika’s arias, followed by the rush of daily demands. 
          However, this project invites a transformation: to view wakefulness not as 
          a task to be managed but as a state to be created.
          I see my attention as a balancing act infused with creativity. It is 
          physical focus in action, a dynamic state of equilibrium shaped by both 
          the conditions of my body and the external environment. On the balancing 
          board, I am both the doer and the receiver: a composer of spontaneous sounds 
          and a listener to the unique sounds that emerge. Each morning becomes an 
          exploration of mindfulness and presence, sculpted by the interplay of 
          movement, sound, and mood.
          The metaphor that best captures my attention is that of a creative instrument. 
          Like a wire reshaped to produce unique tones, my attention shifts and adjusts 
          according to the physical and emotional conditions of the moment. Through this 
          interplay, I aim to replace the hurried monotony of coffee-fueled wakefulness 
          with a practice of intentional engagement, one that listens to the rhythms of
          my body and encourages playful curiosity.
          My current relationship with attention reflects a need for intentional pauses. 
          Whether its a morning ritual to center myself or a walk to recalibrate my 
          focus during the day, I am learning to use motion and physical space to reset 
          and ground my awareness. This project takes that practice further, creating a 
          ritual of wakefulness that is not only functional but deeply personal and 
          creatively expressive.
          Ultimately, my goal is to cultivate wakefulness as a state of mindful 
          creativity. By listening to my body, responding to my environment, and 
          allowing spontaneity to shape my mornings, I am fostering a deeper connection 
          to my attention—one that encourages balance, exploration, and attunement 
          to the present moment.

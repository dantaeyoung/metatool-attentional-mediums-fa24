        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          I enhanced my reading space by upgrading my heavy sofa with added rails for easier relocation. I incorporated a flexible plywood screen wrapped in bubble wrap to provide vision isolation and diffuse surrounding light, creating a focused and quiet environment. This adaptable screen design allows for customized configurations, enabling transitions between reading and relaxation.

        <h3>Attentional Theory</h3>
        <p>
          I envisioned attention as an architectural sanctuary when I designed my reading area with carefully planned setting that find a balance between flexibility and structure to encourage concentrated involvement. This metaphor sums up my concept, which turns an ordinary sofa into a customized retreat for reading and reflection.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The underlying support of attention is represented by the hefty sofa, which is first motionless and unyielding. I added mobility by installing railings at the bottom, which made it possible for the area to change to accommodate various purposes and situations. This change represents the ability to shift and realign attention in order to stay focused in the face of life's ever-changing demands. As the railings facilitate moving the sofa, using attention-shifting techniques improves our capacity for focused concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability of the screen to change into different configurations represents the adaptability needed for attention management. The flexibility of the setting mirrors the dynamic nature of attention, whether it is set up for concentrated reading periods or left open for play and leisure. It emphasizes how crucial it is to design areas that may support various forms of interaction in order to promote a healthy balance between focus and leisure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conlusion,  my project aims to shape a symbiotic relationship with attention, where the environment is meticulously designed to support and enhance cognitive focus. By constructing an architectural sanctuary, I create a dedicated space that nurtures sustained concentration and tranquility, facilitating a deeper connection with the act of reading and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I sit on my reading sofa, I feel extremely satisfied and excited. It is like a trigger to put myslef into reading model. The hint will directly push into my mind that "Reading Time Starts!". By isolating from the surroundings, I feel calm, safe and nothing else to worry about. Just like hiding myself from the world and focus whatever I want.
